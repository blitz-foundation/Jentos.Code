	Jentos IDE v1.1

** Themes **

+ Android Studio, dark.
+ Qt Creator, light.
+ Netbeans ,light, is default.
For docs: file pagestyle.css replacing with dark or light version when change theme. But you have to restart the app to see changes.


** Code Analyzer **

+ Correct multiple inheritance.
+ Improve parser for interfaces, now it don't expect of pair 'method-end', just 'method'.
The same bug fixed for abstract methods.
+ Folding for "if,while,for,select" statements; and local variables is local for analyzer inside of them.
+ Import myfile - analyze user's imports.
+ Correct parse templates when there are few arguments in line.
+ Analyze variables from 'For local var:Type = ...'.
+ Analyzing for ':=' expression.
+ Check the file modified time before analyzing; if time isn't changed, then don't analyzing.


** Editor **

+ Choose item from autocomplete list by Tab.
+ "Find Usages / Rename" for user's variables. 
(Don't change documents between find usages and rename! For another rename do Find Usages again. This function opens all files from CodeTree.)
+ Show hint for all user's variables by Ctrl+"mouse over". Click LMB to jump to declaration line.
Note: not showing hint if document has selection, because this prevents copying.
+ Fix for deleting multi-line selection area; early cursor may jump somewhere.
+ Improved tab/untab indention for multi-line selection area.
+ Click on word 'Import' by Ctrl+LMB to open file.
+ Show mark 'ovr.' for overridden methods on the line number area.
